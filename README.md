This program processes input files that contain the outcomes of games for a given season in a given sport. The user will be prompted to enter the name of the text file they want to be processed, but if a file with that name does not exist then the user will continue to be prompted for the name of a text file until they give one that does exist. Each file has the format: (SPORT)\n (SEASON)\n (GAME 1)\n (GAME 2)\n ...\n (GAME N). Each game has the format: (DATE) (TEAM 1) (TEAM 1 SCORE) (TEAM 2) (TEAM 2 SCORE) (FLAGS) (OPTIONAL INFO). If a game contains a home team, the home team's name will be preceded by an "@" symbol. For each file, the total number of games, the number of games with a home team, the percentage of games with a home team, the number of games where the home team won, the percentage of games where the home team won, and the home team average winning margin (the average number of points the home teams scored more than the away teams scored) are calculated and printed.
